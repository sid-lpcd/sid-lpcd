# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong focus on front-end and full-stack development. I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding innovative ways to solve them through code. My expertise spans across technologies like Python, JavaScript, React, and data management, with a strong foundation in engineering principles from my degree at UCL.

## My Work and Interests
I'm particularly interested in start-up environments where agility and problem-solving are key, and I thrive in teams that are pushing the boundaries of technology. I have experience building dynamic user interfaces with React, working on back-end logic, and contributing to data analysis and machine learning projects. I enjoy projects that challenge me to think logically and creatively, and I'm always open to learning new tools and techniques.

## Contributions I'm Proud Of
One project Iâ€™m particularly proud of is a facial recognition system that enhances the ambiance of a room by detecting individuals and triggering personalized music and photo displays. This project allowed me to merge my love for AI with real-world applications in a creative way. Iâ€™ve also made contributions to the development of internal tools using platforms like Retool, helping to improve operational efficiency through technology.

## Communities & Getting Help
Iâ€™m an active member of several developer communities, including GitHub, Stack Overflow, and BrainStationâ€™s Software Engineering Bootcamp. If you ever need guidance, feel free to open an issue on any of my projects, and Iâ€™ll be happy to assist! I encourage collaboration and learning from one another as we grow best together.
